# senior-project
this is my senior project thesis and codes.

The thesis was about COVID and how we can interpret the emotions of Turkish people on Twitter by using Twits. 
The project's implementation starts as mining through the months via TweePy and use neural network architectures (LSTM) to predict next months.
